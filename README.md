# Battle challenge

We are building a simple web app that allows to players to battle!

## Approach

We broke the user stories down into versions of our app and have listed them below:

### Version 1 - start game

```
As two Players,
So we can play a personalised game of Battle,
We want to Start a fight by entering our Names and seeing them
```
12/06/19 - created this page using a form on root index, which posts the names to /names where they are set as values for the session. You're then redirected to /play where the names are displayed using the session hash.

### Version 2 - Player profile build

```
As Player 1,
So I can see how close I am to winning
I want to see Player 2's Hit Points

As Player 1,
So I can see how close I am to losing,
I want to see my own hit points
```

### Version 3 - Effects of Player actions - what moves do

```
As Player 1,
So I can win a game of Battle,
I want to attack Player 2, and I want to get a confirmation

As Player 1,
So I can start to win a game of Battle,
I want my attack to reduce Player 2's HP by 10

As Player 1,
So I can lose a game of Battle,
I want Player 2 to attack me, and I want to get a confirmation

As Player 1,
So I can start to lose a game of Battle,
I want Player 2's attack to reduce my HP by 10
```

### Version 4 - Turns - who does move to who

```
As two Players,
So we can continue our game of Battle,
We want to switch turns
```

### Version 5 - Game over, man!

```
As a Player,
So I can Lose a game of Battle,
I want to see a 'Lose' message if I reach 0HP first
```
